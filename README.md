# BluespotChatApp

A Bluetooth and Hotspot chat app (hence the name BlueSpot) created by me and 2 other students during our Internship at AT&T.

The aim of this app was to chat with friends in close proximity when you cannot speak to each other due to whatever reason. Also included the ability to send files over Bluetooth.

Source code is not publicly available as it was not a unanimous decision.

However, the APK file is available to download and install.
